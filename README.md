# electricity_price_forecasting
This is the repository for the code, datasets, etc. created for my MSc dissertation on electricity price forecasting using time series methods and various statistical learning algorithms found in the current academic literature on electricity price forecasting, including random forests, AR/ARX, SARIMA/SARIMAX, neural networks, and the more novel X-Model (Ziel and Steinert - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988316302080).

### Further edits to be made:
  - "Method Evaluation.ipynb": This is where I implemented the walk-forward validation for the period 2020-01-01 to 2020-07-09
  - Will add a directory tree / description of each file in this README in due course.
